## Highlights from the data analysis

Key for me: make clear why we focus on Akey, why we further focus on Pey (I suggest we just focus on the 'extended', not 'core' set), and point to differences from the early, tentative Vernot conclusion

From results:

- **SNP count and frequency** (in process)
- **Enrichment in Cerebrum and Cerebellum** We investigated the expression patterns across organs. Genes present in deserts showed enrichment for Cerebrum, Cerebellum, and Eye (neuroectoderm-derived structures), while no structures passed significance thethreshold for genes present in AkeyPey.
- *Cell type enrichment* (not done; pending)
- **414 structures** (in process).
- **ABA temporal progression**  Previously, Mafessoni2020 have shown that genes carrying Neanderthal-derived changes and expressed in the striatum during adolescence present a higher McDonald-Kreitman ratio. These same genes are over-represented in genomic regions were modern humans are significantly devoid of Neanderthal introgressed haplotypes (Maffesoni2020). Here we found that genes within deserts have a higher mean expression profile in the striatum during adolescence and, prominently, during infancy (stats pending). When considering genes present in both deserts and putative positively-selected regions, we found a clearly distinct profile for the cerebellum after prenatal stages: from infancy to adulthood (stats pending), while the rest of structures seems to follow a L-shaped trajectory.
