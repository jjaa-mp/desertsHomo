## A distinct expression profile in the cerebellum and striatum for genes under selection within introgression deserts

Analyses of ancient DNA from extinct hominins have provided unique insights into the complex evolutionary history of *Homo sapiens*, intricately related to that of the Neanderthals and the Denisovans as revealed by several instances of admixture events. These analyses have also allowed the identification of introgression deserts: genomic regions in our species that are depleted of archaic haplotypes. The presence of genes like *FOXP2* in these deserts has been taken to be suggestive of brain-related functional differences between *Homo* species. Here, we seek a deeper characterization of these regions, taking into account signals of positive selection in our lineage. Analyzing publicly available transcriptomic data from the human brain at different developmental stages, we found that structures outside the cerebral neocortex, and especially the cerebellum and the striatum at prenatal stages, show the most divergent transcriptomic profiles when considering genes under positive selection within introgression deserts.
