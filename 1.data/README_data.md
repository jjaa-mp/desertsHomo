### Readme data
Data supporting conclusions from the study. Of main importance:

- `distances_pvalues/`. It contains average pvalues (and derived log2 values for representational purposes) from the pairwise comparisons of Euclidean distances based on the first two principal components.
- `stat_freq/` Related to Results findings and Supplementary Table 1 on degrees of fixation of Homo sapiens-specific single-nucleotide changes.
- `trendy_adjR2/` It shows R^2 adjusted values for the segmented regression analysis on gene expression trajectories.
