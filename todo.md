
I included tasks here as questions we aim to resolve. I didn't specifically included the answers, but I marked them for whenever we have adressed them overall. 
Feel free to add more, or to add/modify the tasks. Also, I'm not explicitely including the answers to the solved tasks, to keep this clean in terms of logic.

# Deserts of introgression vs the rest of the genome
[X] are results from previous studies, namely Vernot, similar to what we get?
[X] Are deserts of introgression different from other regions in the genome?

# Deserts of introgression vs regions under positive selection within
[ ] Are regions under positive selection different in their brain expression compared to any other region in the deserts?
[ ] Is this difference noticeable in different brain regions?
[ ] Is it stage-sensitive?

# Regions unders positive selection VS those specifically in deserts
Not adressed so far

# Differences between deserts of introgression
[ ] Is chromosome 7 different in its expression profiles given previous literature on its human uniqueness?


# Differences between genes
[X] Visual representation within the deserts
[ ] What are the differences in the gene trajectories across regions? (stats)
[ ] Are some genes specifically more expressed in a certain brain ragion?
[ ] Have certain genes in the deserts a higher than expected mean expression? 

# Differences across stages of development in different sets
[X] Versus the whole genome
[ ] Between sets (deserts vs pos selection windows within?)
[X] Between genes
