
I included tasks here as questions we aim to resolve. I didn't specifically included the answers, but I marked them for whenever we have adressed them overall. 
Feel free to add more, or to add/modify the tasks. Also, I'm not explicitely including the answers to the solved tasks, to keep this clean in terms of logic.

## Deserts of introgression VS the rest of the genome

- [X] Are results from previous studies, namely Vernot, similar to what we get?
- [X] Are deserts of introgression different from other regions in the genome in terms of brain region values?
- [X] Do you get a different developmental trajectory from genes in the deserts vs the rest of genome?
- [X] Is the distance between the values in the genome and those in deserts particularly significant in the extremes (ie, way more down or upregulation than expected)
- [X] How likely is to have a high expression in particular structures (from genes in deserts), compared to the rest of the genome? Ie, does any structure have a higher or lower mean expression than one would expect from a random part of the genome? 

AA: marking the last one solved unless different method is agreed upon


## Deserts of introgression VS regions under positive selection within
AA: I can take these questions. Targetting question B for thursday 4 - currently dealing with designing a regression model for it

- [X] Are regions under positsive selection different in their brain expression compared to any other region in the deserts?
- [X] How does this affect brain structures? How likely is for a structure to have a high expression relative to others in the regions under positive selection?
- [ ] Is it stage-sensitive?
- [X] Are the extreme values in the distance between the values in the genome and those in positively selected windows in deserts particularly significant? (ie, way more down or upregulation than expected)

## Regions unders positive selection VS those specifically in deserts

- [X] Sestan genes Peyregne not in Akey plots and code
- [ ] Using ABA data

## Differences between deserts of introgression

- [ ] Is chromosome 7 different in its expression profiles given previous literature on its human uniqueness?
- [ ] Are these differences reflected in significantly different expression in specific brain regions?
- [ ] Are they reflected in specific developmental stages?
 
## Differences between genes within positive selection in deserts

- Exploring expression dynamics based on Deseq2

- [X] Trendy package: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2405-x ([Observations](https://github.com/jjaa-mp/raul_tesina/blob/master/Observations.md) updated). (Wed 3rd)

- [X] Visual representation across stages
- [ ] What are the differences in the gene developmental trajectories across regions? (stats)
- [ ] Are some genes specifically more expressed in a certain brain region? (in terms of stats, not only visualization)
- [ ] Have positively selected genes in the deserts a higher than expected mean expression? (Compared to a set of genes of similar characteristics?)
