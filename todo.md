
I included tasks here as questions we aim to resolve. I didn't specifically included the answers, but I marked them for whenever we have adressed them overall. 
Feel free to add more, or to add/modify the tasks. Also, I'm not explicitely including the answers to the solved tasks, to keep this clean in terms of logic.

## Deserts of introgression vs the rest of the genome

- [X] Are results from previous studies, namely Vernot, similar to what we get?
- [X] Are deserts of introgression different from other regions in the genome in terms of brain region values?
- [X] Do you get a different developmental trajectory from genes in the deserts vs the rest of genome?

## Deserts of introgression vs regions under positive selection within

- [ ] Are regions under positive selection different in their brain expression compared to any other region in the deserts?
- [ ] Is this difference noticeable in different brain regions?
- [ ] Is it stage-sensitive?

## Regions unders positive selection VS those specifically in deserts

Not adressed so far

## Differences between deserts of introgression

- [ ] Is chromosome 7 different in its expression profiles given previous literature on its human uniqueness?
- [ ] Are these differences reflected in expression in specific brain regions?
- [ ] Are they reflected in specific developmental stages?
 
## Differences between genes

- [X] Visual representation across stages
- [ ] What are the differences in the gene trajectories across regions? (stats)
- [ ] Are some genes specifically more expressed in a certain brain ragion? (stats, not only visualization)
- [ ] Have certain genes in the deserts a higher than expected mean expression?
